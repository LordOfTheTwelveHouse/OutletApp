I've quickly made this app - this is technically WIP as needs more comments -  however app works and ticked off all the necessary boxes


- App runs
- App UNit tests pass
- App presents fashion clothes, prices, labels propert
- App runs asynchronously

If I had more time, I'd clean everything up - but it's 21:30hrs, I need to sleep and work tommorow too! 

I've spent less than two hours on this -  so factor that in - if I had more time I'd improve it.
