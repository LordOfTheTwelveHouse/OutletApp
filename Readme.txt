Hi,

I've quickly made this app - this is technically WIP as needs more comments -  however app works and ticked off all the necessary boxes


- App runs
- App UNit tests pass
- App presents fashion clothes, prices, labels propert
- App runs asynchronously

- Video attached as IMG : shows the app running
- Screeshot: shows a screenshot of the app

Please see video and image for example of the app running


If I had more time, I'd clean everything up, improve the UX with a loading icon, and comment, and test better the app with UITests too - but it's 21:47hrs, I need to sleep and work tommorow too!

I've spent less than two hours on this -  so factor that in - if I had more time I'd improve it.
